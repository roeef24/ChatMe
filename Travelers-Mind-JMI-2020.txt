                                          Abstract
                                          Traveling to novel destinations can give rise to a state of attention referred to here as a “traveler’s mind”—a state in which
                                          two forms of a popular concept in management and organization studies, mindfulness, occur in tandem. In this essay, written
                                          as a personal narrative, I explore the nature of a traveler’s mind, discuss the conditions under which this state of attention
                                          is most likely to arise, and consider how this state connects to and informs our understanding of related concepts of note
                                          (e.g., mindfulness and sensemaking). I also propose that a traveler’s mind can be achieved not only through travel but also
                                          on a more mundane basis and highlight practices organizations and their members can adopt to foster this state of attention.
                                          Together, the observations provided here suggest that cultivating a traveler’s mind is as much a matter of mind-set as of
                                          geography.
